<p>Metric spaces are an abstract characterization of spaces equipped with a notion of distance. To each pair of elements we assign a number, the <em>distance</em>, between the two points. We must employ the real numbers to quantify distance since the hypotenuse of a unit square is irrational, and it would be silly to lay out a theory of distance that could not account for the euclidean plane. We also only make use of the nonnegative reals, since it’s not clear how to interpret <em>negative</em> distance (how, exactly, would -5 distance differ from +5 distance?).</p>
<p>Let \(X\) be a set, and let \(X_k\) for \(k \leq |X|\) be the set of all subsets of \(X\) with cardinality \(k\). For example, \(X_1\) is the collection of all singletons, and \(X_0\) is a set consisting of the empty set.</p>
<p>A <strong>metric space</strong> is a pair \((X, d)\) where \(d\) is a function \(X_1 \cup X_2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\) such that:</p>
<ul>
<li>For all \(A \in X_1 \cup X_2\), \(d(A) \geq 0\)</li>
<li>\(d(A) = 0\) iff \(A\) is a singleton</li>
<li>For \(A = \{x,y\}\), \(B = \{y,z\}\), \(C = \{x,z\}\) in \(X_2\), \(d(C) \leq d(A) + d(B)\)</li>
</ul>
<p>The first two just say that distances are nonnegative and distinct points have nonzero distance. Probably the most important property is the third, commonly known as the <em>triangle inequality</em>. It says, simply, that there’s no way to shorten a trip from point A to point B by visiting some other point C on the way.</p>
<p>The most common formulation of metric spaces (and definitely easier to work with) is this: <em>d</em> is a function \(X \times X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\) such that:</p>
<ul>
<li>\(d(x,y) \geq 0\) for all \(x\), \(y\), and \(d(x,y) = 0\) iff \(x = y\).</li>
<li>\(d(x,y) = d(y,x)\)</li>
<li>\(d(x,z) \leq d(x,y) + d(y,z)\)</li>
</ul>
<p>An <strong>open ball</strong> of radius r around x is the set of all points in the metric space that are less than a distance r from x. In symbols:</p>
<p>$$ B_r(x_0) = {</p>
<p>A common usage of <q>neighborhood</q> of a point \(x\) is a set that contains an open set that contains \(x\). This practice is not universal, however, as Munkres’ book reserves <q>neighborhood</q> for an <em>open set</em> that contains \(x\). We can reconcile this disparity by keeping <q>neighborhood</q> for the first usage, but calling the second usage an <em>open neighborhood</em>. Or, for fun, we could invent a new word, something like a <em>transparency</em> of \(x\). A transparency is a neighborhood of all of its points.</p>
