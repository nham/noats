computability
 - Starting with the definition of "output", the article is confusing and not well motivated. *Why* do we only care about only one register in the final state? Why not study the computability of functions from N^n to N^m? I'm not actually sure myself, so this may be a can of worms that needs to be avoided.
    
    Also, it's not just that. We introduce the definition of "output", and then several paragraphs later say we're interested in functions N^n to N. But the restriction of our scope to these functions is exactly the reason that output is defined the way that it is. This needs to be reworked.

 - In general, I think that I don't understand computability well enough to motivate the definitions, so that we should skip the shoddy exposition and just define things. Their utility will become evident later, I presume.
