A **group with operators** is a pair $(G, \ast, \Omega)$ such that $(G, \ast)$ is a group and $\Omega$ is a collection of endomorphisms on $G$.

A **field** is a commutative division ring.

A **vector space** is a triple $(V, F, +, \cdot)$ such that:

 - $(V, +, F)$ is a commutative group with operators.
 - $F$ is a field.
 - $\cdot: F \times V \rightarrow V$ is an operation (called *scalar multiplication*) such that for all $v \in V$:

    - $1 \cdot v = v$
    - $(a + b) \cdot v = (a \cdot v) + (b \cdot v)$
    - $(ab) \cdot v = a \cdot (b \cdot v)$
